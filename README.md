# Personalized Lab Instructions for Git and GitHub
In this lab, we will practice essential Git workflows, including:
1. Initializing a repository
2. Branch management
3. Merging changes using pull requests
4. Writing meaningful commit messages

Our goal is to create a simple static website with four pages:

1. A landing page (index.html)
2. Individual pages for each team member
3. Each member will work on their page independently using a feature-branch workflow before merging changes into the main branch.
