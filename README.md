## Problem Statement

Despite Ghana's rich pool of talented artisans and professionals, there is no comprehensive digital platform that connects them with clients while offering skill development resources. Many skilled individuals struggle to monetize their abilities due to the lack of digital visibility, which leads to unemployment and economic stagnation. 

Empower Skills Ghana seeks to address this challenge by providing an integrated solution for showcasing, selling, and developing skills.
